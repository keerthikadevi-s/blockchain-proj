This project developed a secure and efficient system of certificate verification and storage using blockchain, in cooperation with IPFS and the Infura API. This would allow decentralized, tamper-proof, immutable storage. Users can upload certificates in PDF or PNG format, and then the system will automatically extract and decode the QR code embedded in the certificate for a verification link. This link is further validated with the issue-institution's web site for the authenticity of the certificate. Later, the system prioritizes the certificates according to their importance. Moreover, attaching a rewarding scheme acknowledges and governs achievements accordingly and provides validation. Such categorization improves the recognition and enables users to manage their credentials accordingly. This system ensures much-improved security and reliability for digital certificates, reducing the risks of forgery, unauthorized access, and data breaches by capitalizing on the immutability and decentralization of blockchain. It will thus offer an advanced, user-friendly platform that will be able to let both students and institutions manage and represent credible academic records in a secure manner.
